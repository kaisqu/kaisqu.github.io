I am currently a Staff Research Scientist at <img src="../assets/img/meta.png" height="12"/> Reality Labs, California, USA. I worked as an Assistant Professor in <img src="../assets/img/shu.png" height="24"/> Shanghai University, Shanghai, China. I received my Ph.D. degree from Department of Automation, <img src="../assets/img/thu.png" height="24"/> Tsinghua University, Beijing, China, in 2015.

My current research interests include human avatars, multi-modal models, and generative models. I'm dedicated to the creation and understanding of image/video/3d representations. With extensive experience in both academy and industry, I enjoy bringing the knowledge together and benefiting from both side.

Please feel free to [email](KAI1 AT META DOT COM) me if you have any questions.
